# Odk Collect for IOS
ODK (Open Data Kit) Collect for IOS

This is our port of the open data kit collect for IOS. Most of the functions are availalble. The forms developed for odk for android should work almost without changes. At least that's our objective. We have been developing and testing this port for quite some time. We try to be at least 80% compatible with the odk collect for android.

We plan to open source this port eventually. We want to improve first our compatibility with the odk and then make a review of the code to make sure it's up to a nice standard for public consumption.

We still consider this a beta version. Please let us know of any bugs you find when you test your forms. Also please send us your test cases that failed. We will try to address all the major issues as soon as time allows.

We are a company with experience making changes to the android version and will be able to also make changes to the ios version. Let us know if you need any custom work or functions on either of those two platforms. We will be happy to help you. Contact us at dsalazar@gic.mx for anything related to customizations to the ios or android versions of collect at 160 usd an hour.
