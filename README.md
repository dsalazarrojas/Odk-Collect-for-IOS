# Odk Collect for IOS
GIC Collect for IOS compatible with (Open Data Kit) ODK Collect 

# About

This is our port of the open data kit collect for IOS. Most of the functions are available. The forms developed for odk for android should work mostly without changes. We have been developing and testing this port for quite some time. We try to be at least 80% compatible with the odk collect for android.

We still consider this a beta version. Please let us know of any bugs you find when you test your forms. Also please send us your test cases that failed. We will try to address all the major issues and the issues that affect more as soon as time allows. Please add an issue on this repository including your test files if possible. We will be happy to solve issues as time allows or contact me at dsalazar@gic.mx if you wish to discuss your specific needs. Also contact me to be added to the beta version so you can test every new version we release at dsalazar@gic.mx
